#Uponly #Podcast #Arthur0x #Defiance

After watching this episode after 9 months later, I have huge conviction on both #DefianceCapital and crypto. Nearly all his prediction or words have been proved to be true (that's scare to me ðŸ™€). Thus I decide to continue to dig more these kind of free-alpha in the future.

### Notes
- Try do less trade cuz most people not good at it;
- Concentrated is needed to make bigger returns, *eg. less than 5 holdings*;
- Building own investment philosophy&thesis one believe in is important;
- Believe in #Defi as best use case of blockchain,  do not trust enterprise blockchain stuff. Their maybe other use cases when market be mature (proved);
- Team > community > valuation > product > token economics;
- Better to read every blogs, while talking to team;
- #NFT should have more use cases, e.g. #Axie (proved);
- Only top NFTs can save value, most medium level are easy to copy;
- Longhash posted a tokenomoics blog;
- #ETH is expensive, but try to think you are paying for the decentralization;
- 10% - 20% chance #Solana replaces #ETH in years;
- DYDX as a good example, they tried to build their product on #Starkware , which is a case by case situation (proved)
- Read #Multicoin early blogs, really help on investing;
