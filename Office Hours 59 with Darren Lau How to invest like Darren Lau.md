### Notes:
- Darren do not wan to invest similar projects, e.g. only invest one dex project. That's make me think me as individual investor seeking projects invested by many convinced VCs, I should consider they do not want to have repeated investments. Also, they have different invest strategies and styles, among the thesis as backbone. Thus, sorting their portfolio into categories and doing optimization for myself to avoid missing alpha (individual investor is not sensitive to repetitive category of projects)
- "invest before team shown the demo"
- VC's investor is just a signal - you should do DD self
- invest the team who want to use their product first
- do some pro-product project mainly due to the team is experienced and have good background
- yearn is a good place for stable coin
- try to match ppl who is hireable and who always learning
