### Notes:
- From 519:
	- **survive** is the most import thing
	- stop leverage
- Identify narrative
	- find the runs of 0-1 innovation - only way to gain more
	- try to retrospect the same rhythm - *trial & error + pattern recognition*
	- simplify and clear one's mind to be more receptive to these opportunities
- Decision making efficiency
- Do not use limit-order
	- cuz huge mental stress, which is unnecessary (I totally agree!!!)
- Bet sizing
	- Before dd, introduced by others, invest 2%, then add more after size until 20%
	- Beta exposure + high convicted (illiquide) hodl to 0
- Psychology
	- make decision with a clear mind
	- crypto is a longer grind
	- comfy in your own lane, not FOMO
- Plan
	- One could be right on the thesis level but one could still lose because risk on assets
	- plan is a way to prepare for the contingencies
	- execute the plan (flip 2x for me)
	- common trap: u are forced to hold the coin you have belief but down harder
- Shift of the market
- Entry&exit strategy
	- Honest to yourself and review your portfolio
		- Track p&l every week to monitoring your thesis
		- Check your goal, e.g. TVL, volume, talk to team
		- Cut the position wen u find you r wrong (keep asking yourself)
